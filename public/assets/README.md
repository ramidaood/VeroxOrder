# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the VeroxOrder application.

## Structure

- `/images/` - Product images and other media files
- Add other asset subdirectories as needed

## Usage

Assets in this directory are served statically from the public folder and can be referenced directly in the application:

```jsx
// Example usage
<img src="/assets/images/product-image.jpg" alt="Product" />
```

## Guidelines

- Optimize images for web use
- Use descriptive filenames
- Organize by category/type
- Consider using appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF for modern browsers)
